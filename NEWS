Changes in version 0.4.0

- The functions and overall structure of the package should be stable now.

- Added nested_transmute() for transmuting the weights for nested generalized means.

Changes in version 0.3.9

- Added back_period() and base_period(), which are more general than back_price() and base_price().

- Added lehr_index().

- Fixed a rare warning about sqrt() making NaNs in generalized_logmean(-1) when some inputs were close but not equal, despite no NaNs showing in the result.

- The lm_index() and *_agmean_index() functions are now function factories.

Changes in version 0.3.6

- Added the balanced() operator to make it easier to remove NAs with price index functions.

- Added the geks() function for using price-index function (e.g., fisher_index()) to makes a GEKS index.

Changes in version 0.3.4

- Added French translations.

- Made a number of optimizations to make the results of generalized_mean(), extended_mean(), lehmer_mean(), transmute_weights(), and factor_weights() faster in common cases.

- Added the grouped() operator to make all functions work with grouped data.

Changes in version 0.3.1

- Most function names have changed to be less awkward; e.g., mean_generalized() is now generalized_mean(), and contributions_geometric() is now geometric_contributions(). This is unfortunately not backwards compatible, but needed to be done.

- Added the nested_mean() function to calculate nested generalized means for, e.g., the Fisher index.

- The interface for nested_contributions() is now much simpler, and the function is focused on making contributions for Fisher indexes. Added the nested_contributions2() function that implements a different algorithm.

- Added the arithmetic_agmean_index() and geometric_agmean_index() functions to calculate the AG mean index.

- Added some functions for standard outlier-detection methods for price relatives.

- Dropped the 'scale' argument for generalized_mean(), as it really wasn't needed and had the potential to make more problems than it solved.

Changes in version 0.2.5

- Added the back_price() and base_price() functions to make it easier to turn prices stored in a table into price relatives.

- Lots of little improvements to the documentation.

- Simplified the underlying code, resulting in some small performance improvements.

Changes in version 0.2.3

- Added the mean_lehmer() function to calculate the Lehmer mean.

- Added the contributions_nested() function to calculate quote contributions for indexes that are nested generalized means, like the Fisher index.

- Lots of little improvements to the documentation.

Changes in version 0.2.1

- Added a vignette.

- Added the quantity_index() function to turn functions that calculate price indexes into functions that calculate the corresponding quantity index.

- Now works with R >= 3.5.
