Changes in version 0.2.0

- This version doesn't add many new features, but makes a number of improvements and simplifications to the inferface and underlying functions. These changes can break old code.

- Many functions are now function factories to make them easier to use. This means that there are a number of changes to existing functions that can break old code. This mostly affects the index_* functions; for example, calculating a geometric Laspeyres index is now done as index_geometric("Laspeyres")(p1, p0, q0), rather than index_geometric(p1, p0, q0 = q0, type = "Laspeyres"). The index_weights(), weights_change(), weights_factor(), mean_generalized(), and logmean_generalized() functions are also now function factories.

- Added the mean_extended() function to simplify the implementation of the weights_change() function.

- The mean_* and weights_* functions no longer accept logical inputs, nor do they accept infinite exponents.

- The M argument has been removed from the weights_change() functions.

Changes in version 0.1.2

- Lots of improvements to the documentation and examples.

- Added the generalized Stuval index with the index_stuval() function.

- Added the weights_update() function for the common case of price-updating weights in an arithmetc index.

- Functions that say the input should be a vector now check if the input is a vector. This prevents non-name attributes from causing problems in the calculations (like dim).

- weights_change() now allows 'M' to be NA/NaN, returning a vector of NAs.

- Error messages are now more informative.
