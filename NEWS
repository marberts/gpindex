Changes in version 0.2.6

- Added the mean_nested() function to calculate nested generalized means.

- The interface for contributions_nested() is now much simpler, and the function is more focused on making contributions for Fisher indexes. Added the contributions_nested2() function that implements a different algorithm.

Changes in version 0.2.5

- Added the back_price() and base_price() functions to make it easier to turn prices stored in a table into price relatives.

- Lots of little improvements to the documentation.

- Simplified the underlying code, resulting in some small performance improvements.

Changes in version 0.2.3

- Added the mean_lehmer() function to calculate the Lehmer mean.

- Added the contributions_nested() function to calculate quote contributions for indexes that are nested generalized means, like the Fisher index.

- Lots of little improvements to the documentation.

Changes in version 0.2.1

- Added a vignette.

- Added the quantity_index() function to turn functions that calculate price indexes into functions that calculate the corresponding quantity index.

- Now works with R >= 3.5.
