Tools to build and work with bilateral generalized-mean price indexes (and by extension quantity indexes), and indexes composed of generalized-mean indexes (e.g., superlative quadratic-mean indexes, GEKS). Covers the core mathematical machinery for making bilateral price indexes, computing price relatives, detecting outliers, and decomposing indexes, with wrappers for all common (and many uncommon) index-number formulas. Implements and extends many of the methods in Balk (2008), von der Lippe (2007), and the CPI manual (2020).

## Installation

Get the stable release from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gpindex")
```

The development version can be installed from R-Universe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gpindex", repos = c("https://marberts.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

or directly from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak("marberts/gpindex")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(gpindex)

# Start with some data on prices and quantities for 6 products
# over 5 periods.
price6
quantity6

# We'll only need prices and quantities for a few periods.
p1 <- price6[[1]]
p2 <- price6[[2]]
p3 <- price6[[3]]
q1 <- price6[[1]]
q2 <- price6[[2]]

# There are functions to calculate all common price indexes,
# like the Laspeyres and Paasche index.
laspeyres_index(p2, p1, q1)
paasche_index(p2, p1, q2)

# The underlying mean functions are also available, as usually
# only price relatives and weights are known.
s1 <- p1 * q1
s2 <- p2 * q2

arithmetic_mean(p2 / p1, s1)
harmonic_mean(p2 / p1, s2)

# The mean representation of a Laspeyres index makes it easy to
# chain by price-updating the weights.
laspeyres_index(p3, p1, q1)

arithmetic_mean(p2 / p1, s1) *
  arithmetic_mean(p3 / p2, update_weights(p2 / p1, s1))

# The mean representation of a Paasche index makes it easy to
# calculate percent-change contributions.
harmonic_contributions(p2 / p1, s2)

# The ideas are the same for more exotic indexes,
# like the Lloyd-Moulton index.

# Let's start by making some functions for the Lloyd-Moulton index
# when the elasticity of substitution is -1 (an output index).
lloyd_moulton <- lm_index(-1)
quadratic_mean <- generalized_mean(2)
quadratic_update <- factor_weights(2)
quadratic_contributions <- contributions(2)

# This index can be calculated as a mean of price relatives.
lloyd_moulton(p2, p1, q1)
quadratic_mean(p2 / p1, s1)

# Chained over time
lloyd_moulton(p3, p1, q1)
quadratic_mean(p2 / p1, s1) *
  quadratic_mean(p3 / p2, quadratic_update(p2 / p1, s1))

# And decomposed to get the contributions of each relative.
quadratic_contributions(p2 / p1, s1)
```

## Prior work

There are a number of R packages on the CRAN that implement the standard index-number formulas (e.g., **IndexNumber**, **productivity**, **IndexNumR**, **micEconIndex**, **PriceIndices**). While there is support for a large number of index-number formulas out-of-the box in this package, the focus is on the tools to easily make and work with any type of generalized-mean price index. Consequently, compared to existing packages, this package is suitable for building custom price/quantity indexes, calculating indexes with sample data, decomposing indexes, and learning about or researching different types of index-number formulas.
