\title{Generalized logarithmic mean}

\description{
Calculate a generalized logarithmic mean.
}

\usage{
logmean_generalized(a, b, r, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5)

logmean(a, b, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5)
}

\arguments{
\item{a, b}{A numeric vector.}

\item{r}{A number giving the order of the generalized logarithmic mean.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance used to determine if \code{a == b}.}
}

\value{
A numeric vector, the same length as \code{max(length(a), length(b))}.
}

\details{
Returns the value of the generalized logarithmic mean of \code{a} and \code{b} of order \code{r}. See Bullen (2003, p. 385) for a precise statement, or \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolarsky_mean}. The logarithmic mean corresponds to the generalized logarithmic mean of order 0. The function \code{logmean(a, b)} simply calls \code{logmean_generalized(a, b, 0)}.

By definition, the generalized logarithmic mean of \code{a} and \code{b} is \code{a} when \code{a == b}. The \code{tol} argument is used to test equality by checking if \code{abs(a - b) <= tol}. The default value is the same as in \code{\link[base:all.equal]{all.equal()}}. Setting \code{tol = 0} will test for exact equality, but can give misleading results in certain applications when \code{a} and \code{b} are computed values.

The usual definition of the generalized logarithmic mean lets \code{r} take on values from the extended real line, such that \code{r = -Inf/Inf} returns the minimum/maximum of \code{a} and \code{b}. This is not implemented here, as it does not seem to be of practical value.

As a matter of definition, both \code{a} and \code{b} should be strictly positive. This is not enforced here, but the results may not make sense when the generalized logarithmic mean is not defined.

\code{\link[gpindex]{weights_change}} uses the generalized logarithmic mean to turn an r-generalized mean into a k-generalized mean.

\examples{
# A useful identity (should be TRUE)

x <- 8:5
y <- 4:1
all.equal(logmean(x, y) * log(x / y), x - y) 

# Works for other orders, too

r <- 2

all.equal(logmean_generalized(x, y, r) * (r * (x - y))^(1 / (r - 1)), 
          (x^r - y^r)^(1 / (r - 1)))

# Some other identities from Bullen (example iii on page 385)

all.equal(logmean_generalized(1, 2, -2), 
          (mean_harmonic(1:2) * mean_geometric(1:2)^2)^(1/3))

all.equal(logmean_generalized(1, 2, 0.5), 
          (mean_arithmetic(1:2) + mean_geometric(1:2)) / 2)

all.equal(logmean(1, 2),
          mean_geometric(1:2)^2 * logmean(1, 1/2))
