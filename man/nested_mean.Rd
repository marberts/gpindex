\title{Nested generalized mean}

\description{
Calculate the (outer) generalized mean of two (inner) generalized means.
}

\usage{
## Function factory
nested_mean(r1, r2, t = c(1, 1))

## Special case
fisher_mean(x, w1, w2, na.rm = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{r1}{A finite number giving the order of the outer generalized mean.}

\item{r2}{A pair of finite numbers giving the order of the inner generalized means.}

\item{t}{A pair of strictly positive weights for the inner generalized means. The default is equal weights.}

\item{x}{A strictly positive numeric vector.}

\item{w1, w2}{A strictly positive numeric vector of weights, the same length as \code{x}. The default is to equally weight each element of \code{x}.}

\item{na.rm}{Should missing values in \code{x}, \code{w1}, and \code{w2} be removed? By default missing values in \code{x}, \code{w1}, or \code{w2} return a missing value.}
}

\value{
\code{nested_mean()} returns a function:

\preformatted{function(x, w1, w2, na.rm = FALSE){...}}

This computes the generalized mean of order \code{r1} of the generalized mean of order \code{r2[1]} of \code{x} with weights \code{w1} and the generalized mean of order \code{r2[2]} of \code{x} with weights \code{w2}.

\code{fisher_mean()} returns a numeric value for the geometric mean of the arithmetic and harmonic means (i.e., \code{r1 = 0} and \code{r2 = c(1, -1)}).
}

\note{
There is some ambiguity about how to remove missing values in \code{w1} or \code{w2} when \code{na.rm = TRUE}. The approach here is to remove missing values when calculating each of the inner means individually, rather than removing all missing values prior to any calculations. This means that a different number of data points could be used to calculate the inner means. Use the \code{\link[=balanced]{balanced()}} operator to balanced missing values across \code{w1} and {w2} prior to any calculations.
