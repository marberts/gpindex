## gpindex (development version)

- Bumped minimum version of R to >= 4.1.

- `geks()` is now faster and uses less memory to makes the GEKS index.

- Time periods with entirely missing data no longer return an index value
with `geks()`, fixing #8.

- Added a new vignette to better explain decomposing an index.

- Added `martini_index()` to compute the family of Martini indexes.

- Added `kimber_method()` for outliers detection.

- Outlier detection functions are now stricter about their inputs.

## gpindex 0.6.2

- `splice_index()` now keeps names.

- Fixed a bug with `transmute_weights()` where the weights could be negative.

- Price-index functions have better argument checking.

## gpindex 0.6.1

- Updated maintainer email.

- Added a parameter to generalize `geks()` by controlling how indexes are
averaged over the rolling window.

- Fixed a bug where `transmute_weights()` and `factor_weights()` could return
a result with a different length than `w`.

- Added a new function `splice_index()` for splicing indexes calculated over
a rolling window (this was previously sketched in an example).

- `transmute_weights()` is now faster.

## gpindex 0.6.0

- Bumped minimum version of R to at least 4.0.

- The use of `...` in `grouped()` and `balanced()` is deprecated, and will be
removed in a future version. The same behavior can be had by using an
anonymous function.

- Added the `walsh_geks()` function.

- `back_period()` and `base_period()` gain a new argument `match_first` to
control whether products in the first period match to themselves or return `NA`.

- Updated documentation.

- Added a brief vignette.

## gpindex 0.5.0

- `back_price()` and `base_price()` have been removed.

- Functions for transforming weights only keep the attributes of the weights
(if any), as documented.

- `grouped()` no longer mangles names.

## gpindex 0.4.3

- `back_price()` and `base_price()` are deprecated in favor of the more
general `back_period()` and `base_period()` functions. They will be removed in
a future version.

- The algorithm for making GEKS indexes is now much faster with a rolling window.

## gpindex 0.4.2

- The functions and overall structure of the package should be fairly stable
from now on.

- Added `nested_transmute()` and `nested_transmute2()` for transmuting the
weights for nested generalized means. To be consistent with argument names, the
first two arguments for `nested_mean()` and `nested_contributions*()` are
now `r1` and `r2`.

- Added the geometric Theil and Rao indexes.

## gpindex 0.3.9

- Added `back_period()` and `base_period()`, which are more general
than `back_price()` and `base_price()`.

- Added `lehr_index()`.

- Fixed a rare warning about `sqrt()` making NaNs in
`generalized_logmean(-1)` when some inputs were close but not equal, despite
no `NaN`s showing in the result.

- The `lm_index()` and `*_agmean_index()` functions are now function factories.

## gpindex 0.3.6

- Added the `balanced()` operator to make it easier to remove NAs with price
index functions.

- Added the `geks()` function for using price-index function
(e.g., `fisher_index()`) to makes a GEKS index.

## gpindex 0.3.4

- Added French translations.

- Made a number of optimizations to make the results
of `generalized_mean()`, `extended_mean()`, `lehmer_mean()`,
`transmute_weights()`, and `factor_weights()` faster in common cases.

- Added the `grouped()` operator to make all functions work with grouped data.

## gpindex 0.3.1

- Most function names have changed to be less awkward;
e.g., `mean_generalized()` is now `generalized_mean()`,
and `contributions_geometric()` is now `geometric_contributions()`. This is
unfortunately not backwards compatible, but needed to be done.

- Added the `nested_mean()` function to calculate nested generalized means
for, e.g., the Fisher index.

- The interface for `nested_contributions()` is now much simpler, and the
function is focused on making contributions for Fisher indexes. Added
the `nested_contributions2()` function that implements a different algorithm.

- Added the `arithmetic_agmean_index()` and `geometric_agmean_index()` functions
to calculate the AG mean index.

- Added some functions for standard outlier-detection methods for price
relatives.

- Dropped the `scale` argument for `generalized_mean()`, as it really wasn't
needed and had the potential to make more problems than it solved.
